# Eloquent JavaScript Exercises

I've been working in JavaScript for almost a year at the time of this writing, but I figured it would probably be a good idea to give the fundamentals 
another run through, and to brush up on some of my weak spots such as recursion and the prototype hierarchy. I would highly reccomend Eloquent JS for all 
beginners, as it gives easy to understand explanations for all of the JS fundamentals as well as some more in depth stuff. There are exercises at the end 
of each chapter, and I am putting all of my solutions here as I work through the book.
